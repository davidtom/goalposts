# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Domain.create(name: "streamable.com")
# Highlight.create(title: "Some Guy scores a goal for Some Team")
# Team.create(name: "Some Team")
# Player.create(name: "Some Guy")
# Country.create(name: "SOME COUNTRY")
#
# ## Everything below must be copied and pasted into rails c - too lazy to set up
# #  associations above...
# domain = Domain.find(1)
# highlight = Highlight.find(1)
# team = Team.find(1)
# player = Player.find(1)
# country = Country.find(1)
#
# domain.highlights << highlight
# team.highlights << highlight
# player.highlights << highlight
# country.players << player
